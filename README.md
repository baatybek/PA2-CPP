There is a new homework problem is given every 2 weeks for Programming and Algorthims 2 course.

We are given 2 weeks to find solution with C++ and we would upload solutions into the testing environment of the subject.

The solutions were not perfect, but I did my best at that time with my knowledge I had. Looking back I am smiling how it was to work on these small projects.

I have resolved 5 out of 7 problems, because I had other subjects to focus on, so I did my best at the moment.
